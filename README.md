# 1stAttemptSudokuSolver

This program will EVENTUALLY get the solution to most sudoku puzzles, the simpler ones are relatively quick (a few minutes), while the harder ones can take VERY long  (20-30 minutes to effectively infinity). I will next try to speed this program up via some path, so all puzzles can be solved hopefully relatively quickly.
